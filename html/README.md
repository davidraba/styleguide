HTML(5)
=======

Each HTML document starts with a the [HTML5 doctype][1]. All documents will
consist of at least an ``<html>, <head>, and <body>`` tag. Documents markup is
well-formed and properly nested. Each opening tag has a matching closing tag or
is self-closing. 

Semantic Markup
---------------

Markup shall be [semantic][2], meaning, the tags used to markup content will be
reflective on the intention of the markup itself. Briefly, if something is a
list, it shall be marked up as a list (<ol>, <ul>, <dl> as appropriate) rather
than just a set of <span> or <p> tags in sequence.

Markup shall be accessible per section [508][3].
