EHP "HazDev" Styleguide
=======================

This project documents the coding style guide to be used by the Earthquake
Hazards Program (EHP) Hazards Development (HazDev) team. This project should be
considered a "living document" that adapts to best practices over time. If you
do not remain actively involved with the HazDev team over time, be sure to
re-check this style guide before starting any new development.

General
-------

### Spacing

We use "smart tabs"  with a two-column tab stop. This means use hard-tab
characters for indentation while using space characters for alignment.

### Column Width

We use an 80 column max width on our documents. This rule should be followed as
often as is feasible without breaking language syntax rules. If a single line of
code is wrapped to two or more lines in the file, the subsequent line(s) should
be indented by two tabs offset from the starting line of code.

### Whitespace

All trailing white space should be removed. A final newline should be inserted
at the end of every file. A single line feed character is used for new lines.
